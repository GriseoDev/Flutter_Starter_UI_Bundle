# Flutter App UI Starter Bundle — Preview Only

## What this is
This repository is a **preview-only showcase** of the Flutter App UI Starter Bundle.  
It exists to show the UI structure and visual quality before purchase.

**No source code is included here.**

---

## What problem it solves
Indie Flutter developers often waste time designing standard app screens or end up with inconsistent UI when mixing templates.

This bundle provides a **clean, coherent UI foundation** so you can:
- Skip early design decisions
- Start with a professional look
- Focus on product logic instead of layouts

---

## Who this is for
- Indie Flutter developers
- Solo founders building MVPs or SaaS apps
- Developers who want solid UI without design overhead

Not intended for beginners, tutorials, or backend-focused projects.

---

## Screens included in the bundle
- Login Screen  
- Onboarding Screen  
- Dashboard / Home Screen  
- Profile Screen  
- Settings Screen  
- **Analytics Screen (core screen)**  

All screens follow the same layout logic, spacing, and visual language.

---

## Why the Analytics Screen is the core value
Simple screens are easy to design.  
A **credible analytics or dashboard screen** is not.

The Analytics Screen:
- Defines the visual standard for the entire app
- Makes your product feel serious and business-ready
- Is typically the most time-consuming screen to design well

The rest of the bundle is built around this core screen.

---

## Preview only (important)
This repository contains:
- UI screenshots
- Visual previews of all included screens

It does **not** contain:
- Flutter source code
- Backend logic
- State management

The full, usable Flutter UI code is available **only via Gumroad**.

---

## Why buy the bundle instead of single templates
- Consistent UI across all core app screens
- No time lost aligning styles manually
- Lower total cost than buying templates individually
- Feels like one real product, not a patchwork
